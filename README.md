# Insurance-Price-Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the insurance premium cost based on user details like age, gender, BMI, number of children, and smoking status. Built using Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn, the app offers a simple and interactive interface for real-time predictions.
